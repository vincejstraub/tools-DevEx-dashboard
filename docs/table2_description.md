#### Column descriptions

* **Animal ID**: identification number assigned to each animal being tracked, currently set to serial number of camera used to film trajectory.
* **Tank**: tank in which animal being tracked is located.
* **Median activity (cm)**: median activity per time interval, where time interval is set by the user (default=60 minutes).
* **Mean step length (cm)**: mean displacement between consecutive data points across the entire trajectory.
* **Max step length (cm)**: max displacement between consecutive data points across the entire trajectory.
* **Step length var (cm^2)**: displacement variation across the entire trajectory.
* **Step length s.d. (cm)**: displacement standard deviation across the entire trajectory.
* **Mean RTA (deg)**: mean relative turning angle, change in heading between consecutive relocations, across the entire trajectory.
* **RTA s.d. (deg)**: standard deviation of relative turning angles across the entire trajectory.
